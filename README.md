To put your map in **DOS** civilization 1, open your the civilization's folder, and find the files called CIVIL"number".map and CIVIL"number".sve . These are your saves, if you want to replace a save, delete both and put the files you downloaded with the same name they had, if not, just place the files in civilization's folder. To know what save you want to replace, the game will say the save name after saving and saying to press key (that is right mouse button)
